# CB_22632 - Exploring Inequalities in Adult Social Care - CY P03-24-01
This study forms part of a PhD project of the Data Analytics and Society’s Centre for Doctoral Training, an ESRC funded initiative providing postgraduate research and training across 4 Universities: University of Leeds, University of Manchester, University of Sheffield and University of Liverpool. While the protocol associated with this specific exploratory study has not been peer reviewed, the aims and structure of the ongoing exploratory data science projects associated with the Centre for Doctoral Training have been peer reviewed by the relevant ESRC Panel. 

Once a study design for the project is finalised it will be submitted for ethical approval at a relevant Research Committee at the University of Leeds. The University’s guidelines for ethical review are designed to complement that provided by NHS Health Research Authority. Given the level of detail in the research design required for ethical review, and the nature of the requested data, formulating the research design will require an initial phase of exploratory analysis. In addition, given our focus on supporting applied decision making, we propose the study design be developed in collaboration with the members of Bradford's NIHR Health Determinants Research Collaboration team.
